<h2>THE FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The reminiscences of his life and work were
dictated to me by my father during the summer of
1916. He touched only upon the main events.
There are countless unmentioned things that
would add to this story of a wonderfully full
life, but I leave it just as he told it to me as we
sat together on the porch, or in the library by
the open wood fire. To these I have added a
few tributes and some clippings from Georgia
newspapers.</p>

<h2>[<i>Editorial from "The Constitution," Atlanta, Ga.,
Sunday, February 18, 1917</i>]</h2>

<p class="center b12">THE WORK OF JOHN P. FORT</p>


<p>No man of his day accomplished more in the
nature of everlasting benefit for the state in which
he lived than the late John P. Fort did for Georgia.</p>

<p>He was a man of vision&mdash;a dreamer&mdash;but with
the energy and the faith and the resourcefulness
to push ahead, explore his vision, and make his
dreams come true; and in the doing of which he
made of himself a notable public benefactor.</p>

<p>Especially thankful should south Georgia be
for the very revolutionizing of the health conditions
of that section which he did so much to
bring about.</p>

<p>South Georgia was once afflicted with a malarial
condition which seriously impaired the many
advantages of that part of the state. The development
of the country had been held back through
generation after generation, despite its fertility
and adaptability to agriculture, simply because of
malarial conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>John P. Fort turned his attention to the
problem.</p>

<p>"It's the water," he said. And he set himself
the task of finding a remedy.</p>

<p>With no guide save his reason and determination,
he managed somehow to bore a hole into the
earth more than five hundred feet deep; and was
rewarded by a stream of pure, life-giving water.
That was Georgia's first artesian well; and, as
he says in a remarkable letter to Alfred C.
Newell, written in October, 1907, and reproduced
in the magazine section of this issue of
<cite>The Constitution</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The well has furnished drinking water during
the summer time mostly for a circular area of ten
or more miles in diameter for twenty-six years,
parties coming in wagons with utensils to convey
the water away for drinking purposes."</p></blockquote>

<p>That well, still flowing undiminished, proved
the rejuvenation of South Georgia. It was followed
by the boring of hundreds of others, and
the result is that to-day residents of South Georgia
are as free from the taint of malaria as are those
of "the hills of Habersham."</p>

<p>The genius of the man again was manifested
when, sensing the possibilities of the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
resources of south Georgia swamps, always
before his day looked upon as worthless and inaccessible,
he managed to get capital interested,
and, under his guiding hand, the cypress lumber
production of the state became one of its great
industries.</p>

<p>What he did for the fruit&mdash;especially the apple&mdash;industry
in North Georgia is known to every man
at all conversant with the state's development.</p>

<p>A lake in the southern part of the state covered
acres of fertile soil. Generation after generation
of men had found no means of drainage. Fort
found one. He studied the geological formation
of the country, applied the knowledge he had
gained by his artesian well operations, and reasoned
that probably the lake could be drained&mdash;as
no man ever had drained a lake before&mdash;from
beneath. So he exploited his theory, bored a hole
straight downward in the center of the lake;
and the waters ran out, leaving the bed ready
for the plow.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of the pond were left on the
muddy bottom," he writes to Mr. Newell, "among
which was a large alligator. A strange and
wonderful sight to behold!"</p>

<p>And thus he spent his useful, constructive, busy
life; doing original&mdash;often daring&mdash;things, all for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the good of mankind and the development of his
country.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly gratifying too, that, unlike
most men whose names illuminate the pages of
our history, Fort lived to see his good works, or
many of them, fructify. He was honored in life,
and was appreciated for what he had done; but
with the passing of time that appreciation of him
and his life work will grow, and the future generations
will honor and revere his name, it is safe to
predict, more pronouncedly even than do we
who were contemporaneous with him.</p>

<p>As time goes on undoubtedly the real greatness,
the constructive genius of Fort will become even
more generally recognized than it is to-day. The
value of his great service to the community will
become more apparent in the future than it has
in the past; and he, in the sphere of practical
scientific achievement and agricultural and industrial
development, will be given rank in history
along with Sidney Lanier, in poetry; Alexander
H. Stephens, in politics; and Le Conte in science.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL REMINISCENCES</h2>


<p>My father, Dr. Tomlinson Fort, was born in
Burke County, Georgia, July 14, 1787. He was
the son of Arthur Fort, who was a soldier in the
Revolutionary War and a prominent man in the
pioneer days of Georgia. My father studied
medicine at the Philadelphia Medical College
under the famous Dr. Rush to whose memory
he was ever attached. He returned to Georgia
settling at Milledgeville, then the capital of the
State. He had a large medical practice, the most
extensive in middle Georgia, which he kept up
until ill health forced him to retire only a short
while before his death in 1859. He represented
his county twelve years in the State legislature,
and his district two years in Congress. He was
for years president of the State Bank and trustee
of the University of Georgia. He then retired
from political life. He served as a captain in the
War of 1812, and was severely wounded while
fighting against the Indians in Florida. Had he
lived until the Civil War I am sure that he would
have opposed secession. He was strong for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Union, and much opposed to negro slavery. I
remember hearing him say that he could never
look upon his slaves, which were about fifteen
or twenty, with any degree of satisfaction. He
was a quiet, grave man of great sobriety and
learning. For general information I have never
met his equal. He had the confidence of all that
knew him, the love of family and friends. He
was a most kind and sympathetic father. He
was the greatest man I have ever known.</p>

<p>My mother, before her marriage in 1824, was
Miss Martha Low Fannin of the Fannin family of
Georgia. She was a woman of great charm and
of great strength of mind and heart. She had
a large family&mdash;thirteen children&mdash;nine of whom
lived to be grown. Her household consisted of
ten or eleven servants. Ours was an open house,
friends and relatives always coming and going.
Mother was a busy woman and a very economical
one, knitting our stockings and making our cloth
caps. She loved her children devotedly, which
love was returned by them.</p>

<p>I was born in Milledgeville, August 16, 1841;
there I passed my boyhood and youth. My
early education was at a common school. The
school was carried on under the principle of the
lash. It was thought necessary to force knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by whipping. A child missing two words in a
lesson was usually whipped. My first teacher was
an Englishman named White. His invariable
rule was to whip a pupil found not studying his
lesson. In one of my first reading lessons I had
to repeat "As high as the sky" in a peculiar singing
manner, which I could not do to please him.
He stood over me with a hickory; I was only a
little boy, seven or eight, and I was frightened.
At last I said it in a way that suited him. He
then grabbed me up, put me on his shoulder, and
marched around the room. Our next teacher,
Little, also whipped for the slightest offense.
One day after school hours several boys, among
whom was I, went to the schoolhouse and for
revenge broke up the furniture. Fights between
the teachers and larger boys were the natural
outcome of such system.</p>

<p>When a boy I was very fond of the woods and
streams, and everything connected with nature.
My father took great pains to instruct me in these
matters, and in talking to him and asking questions,
I obtained a large insight into nature&mdash;much
more than is usual with boys of my years.</p>

<p>I was interested specially in birds. I remember
that a couple of bluebirds built their nest in a hole
in a mulberry tree that grew in the yard. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
day I announced that the young had hatched, as
I could hear their chirpings when the parent birds
approached the nest. No one else could hear
them and I was blindfolded to prove my statement,
which I successfully did. I timed the visits
of the old birds. On the average, once in twelve
minutes a worm or some insect was brought to
the young. At about that time I had a small
collection of birds, which I had skinned and
stuffed. These I kept in my room. One day
an old gentleman, Mr. Armstrong, who was visiting
in our house, when told of my fondness for
birds, said to me, "Young man, I have never
known any one with an interest in such things who
ever amounted to anything." I was greatly mortified
by this harsh criticism, and made a bonfire
of my birds. My mind and temperament from
childhood have been those of a naturalist.</p>

<p>Milledgeville is on the Oconee River at the
mouth of Fishing Creek. Swimming was the
favorite sport with the boys of the town. I was
in the water a great deal and was a fine swimmer.
To give an incident I remember well: A boyhood
friend, Joe Bell, was drowning; I caught him by
the hair and pulled him out, thus saving his life.
At a later time he saved mine in the following
manner: During the Civil War, in a mix-up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
swamp, we were fired upon by some of our own
men. Just as one of them had his gun leveled on
me, his officer, who was Joe Bell, recognized me
and threw up the man's gun. We were quits.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN P. FORT AT THE AGE OF TWELVE</p></div>
</div>

<p>When sixteen years of age I entered the Freshman
class of Oglethorpe College. This was a
Presbyterian school, situated at a little town called
Midway, about two miles from Milledgeville.
The president of the college was Rev. Samuel
Talmadge, an eminent Presbyterian divine. Two
members of the faculty, Mr. James Woodrow,
Professor of Chemistry, and Mr. Charles Lane,
Professor of Mathematics, were living until a few
years ago. I walked to and from college for four
years, carrying my dinner bucket. There were
usually five or ten of us walking together. I remember
on one of these walks killing a dove with
a throw of my Latin grammar. There were two
literary societies at college, the Phi Deltas and
the Thalians. I was president of the Phi Delta
during my senior year, but I never took a high
stand in my class, as I was not a student. I was
more fond of nature. Especially during vacations
I was in fields and woods with rod and gun, and
became a proficient sportsman.</p>

<p>Two of my classmates are still living, Samuel
Quarterman and his brother Pratt. Sam lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
near Albany, Georgia, and Pratt in Quincy,
Florida. Sidney Lanier, Georgia's most distinguished
poet, was in my class. I remember him
as a slender young man of medium height, light
hair, hazel eyes, and aquiline features&mdash;an ideal
picture of the poet and musician he afterwards
proved to be. I do not remember that he was
especially studious or wrote poetry while at college.
I do remember, however, his proficiency in
playing the flute. The strains of melody brought
forth from this little instrument dwell with me
until now. Lanier learned so easily that he carried
off first honor in his class. Later we renewed
friendship of college days. I remember going
with him to Brunswick, Georgia, and viewing with
him the broad marshes, which inspired his celebrated
poem, <cite>The Marshes of Glynn</cite>.</p>

<p>College days came to a close, and I began the
study of law in the office of Mr. William McKinley
in Milledgeville. I was not old enough to vote, but
I was an ardent follower of Stephen A. Douglas in
the presidential election of 1860, and because of
this, was called by the boys at college the "Little
Giant" although I, in no way, resembled him in
stature. I took a lively interest in the stirring
events of the time. The question of negro slavery
usurped the place of all other questions. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
came John Brown's raid which created an incredible
excitement. No "Free Soilers" like Horace
Greeley or William Lloyd Garrison dared visit the
South for fear of actual violence. Then came the
secession of South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida. Georgia felt in honor bound to follow.
Then came the inauguration of President Lincoln
and the firing on Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>The proclamation of Mr. Lincoln calling for
volunteers to overrun the South consolidated the
people of Georgia, and as one man we offered
our services in defense of our homes. The excitement
was intense. I know my father, if he
had been alive, would have opposed secession.
Although she greatly disapproved of war and
secession my mother did not put a veto on her
three sons going. On the night that Georgia
seceded all the houses in Milledgeville were
illumined except ours.</p>

<p>All my strongest feelings were aroused. I felt
called to defend my country. In May, 1861,
I joined a company from my home town, called
after my father's old company, the "Baldwin
Volunteers." I entered as a private soldier. I
was entirely ignorant of everything pertaining to
military affairs. If I had known as I afterwards
did the difference between the status of a soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in the ranks and a commissioned officer, I doubtless
would have aspired to, and obtained, a commission,
but I refused to consider the matter at
all. I preferred to handle a gun, as this appealed
to me as being more in accordance with the patriotic
fervor that encompassed my being. I was
a slender, immature young man of nineteen. It
looked as if I would be unable to endure the
hardships of camp life, but I soon became hardened
to it, and became an efficient soldier; always
up on the company's line; always up on the march;
always ready for any duty. The rigor of camp life
agreed with me and from one hundred and thirty
pounds I soon weighed one hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>It was the 9th of June, 1861, before arms could
be obtained. Then our company was transferred
to a camping ground at Atlanta, where we all duly
signed articles of enlistment. We were attached
to the 9th Georgia regiment. We were the first
regiment to enlist for the war. All enlistments
before that time had been for twelve months. The
magnitude of the peril and the hardship, blood, and
strife incident to our enlistment were not in the
slightest anticipated. We thought it would be
a short campaign. We knew nothing of the disposition
of our opponents and of the bitterness
and bloodshed that were to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Our officers were all elected by ballot. The
colonel was a Mr. Goulding, who soon dropped
out. The captain of my company was Benjamin
Beck of Milledgeville. I was made first
corporal without asking for the position. Afterwards
I was made a sergeant and acted for a
while as first sergeant. I had reason to know
afterwards that any office is preferable to the
position of a private.</p>

<p>About the middle of June we were transported
by rail in cattle and box-cars to Richmond, Virginia.
There the regiment was drawn up in line
of battle and we had our first dress parade. Our
regiment was soon ordered to Strasburg, Virginia;
there we disembarked from the train and
commenced our march down the beautiful Shenandoah
Valley to Winchester. Large wagon trains
were in attendance to transport our tents and
camp equipage. How great a change gradually
came over our transportation department! From
several wagons to a company, we were reduced
eventually to one to the regiment, known as the
skillet wagon, as the men kept their cooking
utensils in it.</p>

<p>Our regiment was armed with an ordinary
smooth-bore musket which shot a cartridge loaded
with a ball and three buckshot. By actual trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
our guns with such a cartridge were only effective
a short distance, and would not bear the
ball and shot at direct range more than eighty
yards. Our cartridges were gradually changed
to one with a single ball. Each soldier carried
a belt of leather around his waist to which was
attached a cartridge box containing forty rounds
of cartridges and a cap box with about fifty
percussion caps. This musket was used up to
the end of the war, although a large part of the
army gradually changed for Enfield rifles, a
better gun with a range two or three times as
far as a muzzle loader. The Federals had an
immense advantage with their superior breech-loading
Spencer rifles, which carried three times
as far as our rifles, and shot ten times to our
one. Toward the end of the war this was equivalent
to doubling the Federal force.</p>

<p>During our first marches our knapsacks and all
camp equipment were hauled in wagons. But soon
we were required to carry our knapsacks; but we
eventually threw them away, and carried our clothing
in a roll. The shoes I wore were splendid,&mdash;made
by a shoemaker at home, and my socks had
been knitted by my mother.</p>

<p>At Winchester we were attached to Gen. Francis
S. Bartow's brigade. The army was in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who rode down our
line, and I had my first sight of our commanding
general. After remaining in camp at Winchester,
we were ordered to march farther down the valley
toward Martinsburg. Near there we were drawn
up in line of battle expecting an attack. While
waiting we were suddenly ordered across the
valley toward Manassas Junction. We marched
all night; when the sun rose not more than one-fifth
of the men had reached our destination.
I was among the foremost. In this connection
I wish to state that I had an extraordinary endurance
on long fatiguing marches. I never met
a man in the army whom I thought my superior
in endurance.</p>

<p>Our brigade waited by the railroad expecting
to be transported to Bull Run. But as transportation
was very limited the 9th Georgia was left
behind. We could hear the roar of battle, and
early next day we were upon the historic field of
Bull Run, generally known as the First Battle
of Manassas. We marched over the battlefield
only to see the dead and wounded Federals. I
saw the first dead I had ever seen. It made an
impression of horror upon me that I remember
to this day.</p>

<p>I recollect a day or two after the battle I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
upon a horse, wounded in the shoulder, standing
in the shade of a tree. The wound was such that
he had no power to twitch or move the muscle of
his shoulder to frighten the great number of horse
flies which were sucking his blood. I was struck
with the wise provision of nature that gives the
horse the power of shaking off insects by a twitch
of the skin.</p>

<p>General P. G. T. Beauregard, who commanded
the Confederate forces, rode down our line. We
gave him a cheer, and I remember crying out, "Let
us go forward." My impression was the right one.
If our victory had been followed up, we could easily
have captured Washington, and the outcome of
the war would have been very different. But we
waited and gave the aroused North full time to
recover from their defeat, and place large armies
in the field.</p>

<p>While on picket duty on the hills in sight of
Washington, our regiment was under fire for the
first time. I remember on one occasion I had been
standing with my hand upon a plank&mdash;I moved
away. A second afterwards a bullet struck the
plank.</p>

<p>We remained several months inactive in camp,
losing valuable time. Camped near us was the
28th Georgia in which was my brother George as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a surgeon. We were also within a few miles of the
1st Georgia Regulars, a splendid body of men, in
which my brother Tomlinson was a first lieutenant.
So I had the pleasure of being near and seeing my
two brothers.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1861-1862 the hardships
of camp life, caused more than anything else by
bad food and water, enfeebled my health. While
lifting a heavy log I sprained my back, and was
ordered to a hospital in Richmond. In Richmond
I met my brother George, so did not go to a hospital,
but stayed with my brother, who, on account
of his poor health, was forced to leave the army.
The surgeon who examined me thought I was permanently
disabled, so I obtained my discharge from
the ranks and went home with Brother George.
At home, in a few months, I partially recovered
my health and insisted on again entering the army.
My mother would not consent to my entering
the infantry, therefore I bought me a good horse
and proposed to ride down to the seacoast where
I would consider the matter, as I was at that time
exempt from service. But I went to Bainbridge
instead, intending, with a Mr. Campbell, to organize
an artillery company. But while there I
met some college friends who had enlisted in a
cavalry company for the coast defense. I joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
them as a private and did some hard riding for
three months along the Florida coast. We were
stationed at Newport, which is near the mouth of
the St. Mark's River in northwest Florida. This
company was a finely appointed body of men.
They furnished their own horses and were splendidly
mounted. They were all young men of position
and education. There seemed to be no distinction
between the officers and men. I do not
think there was a mess in the company that did
not have several servants to cook and wait upon
its members.</p>

<p>I became a good rider, and before I left I was one
of the best in the troop. I was well mounted upon
a fine horse I named "Red Robin." I exchanged
this horse for one called "Flying Ant," which
was considered a very vicious and dangerous
animal, as she had disabled two men before I took
her in charge. I simply wished to show the company
that I could manage her, and I did. She
was a splendid horse. On leaving the cavalry for
the infantry service I sold her, including my fine
cavalry saddle and equipment, to a prominent
man in Quincy, Florida, for fifty-five dollars in
gold, which I was to receive in a few days, but
which I never did.</p>

<p>In January, 1863, I joined the 1st Georgia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Regulars as second lieutenant of Company B.
The regiment had been ordered from Virginia to
Georgia to recruit its ranks. From there they
were ordered to Florida near the junction of the
Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, and there I joined
them.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to give in detail my life in
this regiment&mdash;its toils and privations, marches
and battles. I shall only give incidents in our
campaigns that are personal, and I may often with
but a line pass over long periods of time.</p>

<p>At the time I joined the 1st Georgia, it was
commanded by Major R. A. Wayne. The colonel,
and lieutenant-colonel had been disabled by
wounds and illness and never rejoined the regiment.
Major Wayne became colonel. He was
personally one of the most fearless men I have ever
known. He was a gruff man, short and peremptory
in manner, in camp disliked by his officers and
men, but in time of battle, especially in great
danger, commanding the respect of all.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer of 1863 we performed
picket duty along the coast near the mouth
of the Appalachicola River. This was useless
from a military point of view, and our ranks were
more decimated by malaria than if we had been
in many battles. We were under the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
command of General Howell Cobb. I have never
been able to understand why he kept us there with
the daily report of sickness and death. Oh! the
chills and fever&mdash;and no quinine! This medicine,
so necessary in the treatment of malaria, the
enemy refused to pass into our lines. Three-fourths
of our men and officers were prostrated,
many of them dying. It was a shameful waste
of life. The memory of the sufferings in those
sickly camps will remain with me always.</p>

<p>My brother Tomlinson was the captain in
Company L in the regiment. He was a good
officer, beloved of his men and respected by the
officers of the command. He had been wounded
twice severely, in the Virginia campaigns, on the
field of Malvern Hill he was left for dead with
a wound in the chest from a piece of shell, and
at Second Manassas with a ball through his leg.
He was carried home from our camp on the
Appalachicola River so wasted with malaria,
that I never expected to see him again. All in
the regiment were sick with this disease that
summer and I felt the effects of it through the
entire winter.</p>

<p>Early in 1864 we were ordered to march in all
haste to Quincy, and from there to entrain to Lake
City. We rejoiced to leave our sickly camp. Shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
before we left we were joined by a company of
men, which had been raised in Savannah as a
command to operate heavy artillery. They were
men over fifty and boys under eighteen years of
age. They presented a most unmilitary appearance
in motley civilian clothes.</p>

<p>A large force of Federals had landed at Jacksonville
and intended to march to Tallahassee and take
possession of the State of Florida. Their cavalry
were marching upon Lake City and were within
a few miles of the city when we arrived. Our
small battalion and a company of Florida cavalry
were all the troops we had to receive them. About
a mile from Lake City where we expected to meet
the enemy we formed a line in the pine woods.
Soon they were in sight, and, on seeing our skirmishers,
dismounted and proceeded to attack us.
It was a foggy morning and the enemy approached
within seventy-five or one hundred yards before
we perceived each other. I was given command of
the skirmish line. I was instructed to try to draw
them near to our line. Both sides commenced
firing. Soon the mists rose. The enemy, seeing
our line of battle, retreated with haste. They
outnumbered us two to one. We lost no men.
While walking along the line of skirmishers I was
aware of bullets whistling near me, one going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
through my cap. Then I realized that the white
blanket strapped to my shoulders made a target,
I pulled it off and the firing, especially at me,
ceased.</p>

<p>After this skirmish fighting our forces were
joined by Colquitt's and Harrison's brigade and
we marched forward at once and met the enemy
on the ever memorable battlefield of Olustee.
It was not the intention of our commanding officer,
General Finnegan, to fight the battle where it was
fought. About a mile to the rear our line of
battle had been formed with a protection on
one flank of Ocean Pond and a swamp on the
other. A regiment was sent forward to entice
the enemy to our line of defense; they became
engaged and regiment after regiment was sent
forward to support them until the engagement
became general, resulting in a complete victory
for our forces.</p>

<p>The battle of Olustee was fought in the open pine
woods. The victory was attributed to the courage
and determination of the soldiers. There were no
special tactics or generalship displayed. It was
simply a continuous charge of the enemy to break
our irregular lines which had been formed behind
logs and trees. In this strong position our regiment
of one hundred and fifty men was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
extreme left, with a depression filled with logs in
front. Here we remained many hours resisting
every attack of the enemy, who were many times
our number, to dislodge us. They were in plain
view and being above us presented a fair mark.
At last under shot and shell we rose and charged
them. We had already withdrawn our skirmishers,
so we overran their skirmish line with our line
of battle. They now hastily withdrew and our
victory was complete. The battle lasted from
noon until night. I think it probable that we
killed and wounded more men than we probably
had in our command.</p>

<p>During the battle we were commanded by Capt.
Henry A. Cannon of Wayne County, Georgia. At
the beginning of the battle, after all our men were
in position, I was standing within a few feet of
Captain Cannon. I whispered in his ear that it
was his duty to lie down, or protect himself behind
a tree as I was doing. The enemy was charging
in front of us, and I was satisfied no one could
stand before such a fire. He refused to move, but
stood with his sword drawn calling on the men to
be steady. I had hardly spoken before a ball
struck him. He staggered backward saying, "I
am a dead man." With my left arm under him
I lowered him to the ground. He died at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He was a good officer and a brave man. We were
together in the same mess. I wrote to his wife
an account of his death and sent her a small
amount of Confederate money that Captain Cannon
had left with me. The day before the battle,
while riding near a great live oak tree, he had said
if he should die in battle he would like to be buried
under its branches, so he was wrapped in his
military cloak and buried there. In this battle
I lost another friend, Lieutenant Dancy of Lake
City, Florida.</p>

<p>At that time I had but three or four men in my
company. They were tried and true soldiers and
were too few to require any attention from me.
So I went into the battle with the arms of a private
soldier.</p>

<p>On hearing of the battle of Olustee my brother
Tom returned to the regiment, a very ghost of
his former self. He was wholly unfit for any
kind of service and had to have a negro man to
accompany him. Strange as it may appear, camp
life seemed to agree with him and he soon reported
for duty.</p>

<p>Our camp life in Florida's piny woods was varied
with sham battles between different regiments;
the men used lighted pine burrs at night as ammunition.
Another entertainment was digging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gophers and often a rattlesnake out of their holes.
We ate the gophers and killed the snakes. I remember
one rattler that measured over ten feet
and whose head was as broad as my hand, to
stuff its skin took a bushel of bran, and a straw was
run through the hollow of its fangs. I have never
before or since seen such a serpent. It came out of
a gopher's hole to warm in the sun and its head
was cut off by an officer's sword.</p>

<p>The troops of both armies soon left Florida.
Our regiment was partly filled up with returning
invalids and recruits. We stopped at Savannah
and were sent on Whitemarsh Island to aid in the
coast defense. There and upon Wilmington Island
we performed picket duty upon an extensive
scale. For a short time we were engaged in guarding
a large number of Federal prisoners, who had
been brought from Andersonville to be turned over
to the United States fleet stationed at the mouth
of the Savannah River. The United States Government
refused to exchange prisoners of war
with the Confederate States. The Confederate
authorities wished to avoid feeding and guarding
so many prisoners. So several thousand were
forced on their government on the plea of sickness,
although not one in ten was really sick. These
prisoners were taken down the river on flat barges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I remember their shout of joy when they saw the
Stars and Stripes floating from the masts of the
transports which waited to receive them.</p>

<p>About this time General W. T. Sherman commenced
his famous march through Georgia, with
nearly one hundred thousand men in his command.
There was no force to oppose them. And
their course was marked by fire and pillage. My
mother's house in Milledgeville was robbed of
everything of value. My mother and sisters fled
to Macon just before this army of robbers had
reached Milledgeville. All the men that could be
gathered together opposed Sherman's army as it
approached Savannah. Our regiment marched
from Whitemarsh Island and occupied a prominent
position in the breastwork of defense. General
Sherman and his army confronted us and although
twenty times our number they refused to attack
us, although we offered them defiance for several
days. General Sherman's tactics as a general was
exemplified here. He opposed us with an entrenched
line more than equal to ours and sent a
large force to occupy our flank, thus forcing us to
retreat. Our regiment of about two hundred and
fifty men was commanded by Colonel R. A. Wayne,
a cool, fearless, officer. I was on duty as adjutant
of the regiment. We felt the hazard of our position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The rumor came along the line that we were
to be surrendered as prisoners. We were determined
to resist to the utmost. Suddenly at nightfall
we evacuated our entrenchments and crossed
the Savannah River, leaving the city to be occupied
by General Sherman and his army. It was
on a bitter cold night, December 23, 1864, when we
crossed the river. The scene of our army at midnight
crossing the river on the pontoon bridge
lighted by bonfires and the excitement over the
evacuation are all vividly impressed on my memory.
The next morning when the sun was barely
above the horizon I looked across the wide rice
fields of Carolina, and saw the United States flag
floating above the City Hall of Savannah. The
Federal army was delighted at the capture of
Savannah, especially of twenty-five thousand bales
of cotton, which were stored there. Though this
was private property, it was ordered shipped and
sold for government account.</p>

<p>Our army when we left Savannah was under the
command of General Hardee. It contained only
about eight thousand men, mostly reserves, old
men and boys. We never attempted seriously to
oppose General Sherman in his march through
South Carolina. The march of that army was a
trail of fire and desolation. Their acts of vandalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
accomplished nothing except to embitter
Southern people. Pillars of smoke arising from
barns and peaceful dwellings gave us notice that
Sherman's army had commenced its forward march.
Our little regiment was the rear-guard in nearly all
of our march through the State. I shall not give
in detail the various scenes and incidents connected
with our marches and countermarches in
front of the great Federal army, nor shall I describe
the scenes of confusion among the people.
We had less than ten thousand men of all arms,
of these about five thousand were infantry. The
enemy pursuing us had more cavalry than our
entire force. We, who brought up the rear, would
form in a good position and dare this cavalry
to attack us. They invariably refused to do so.
We were then forced to withdraw before their great
force of infantry could arrive to overwhelm us.
Because of exhaustion and sickness we lost
probably about one-fourth of our army before we
reached Augusta. We passed below Columbia,
but the main body of the Federals took a direct
line to South Carolina's capital with the avowed
purpose of its destruction.</p>

<p>I will now pass over the incidents of our Carolina
campaign, until we reached Cheraw on the
Santee River. The enemy evidently expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that we would give them battle here, because at
this point we had large commissary stores. But
General Hardee had no idea of attempting battle,
except skirmishes. So we used every exertion
to get our army with all the supplies possible
across the Santee River and then burn the bridge.</p>

<p>Our little regiment, comprising less than two
hundred men, was given the dangerous duty of
guarding the river until our cavalry could retire
behind us and then we were to cross the bridge
ourselves. Very soon we saw a dark line of horsemen
among the trees. At first, we supposed that
they were the enemy, but they proved to be our
cavalry, about five hundred men. They came
thundering down the road, crossed the bridge,
and were soon in our rear. Then in the woods we
saw a long line of infantry with their skirmishers
in front advancing slowly to attack our skirmish
line. The immediate command of our skirmishers
was given to my brother, Captain Tomlinson Fort,
a calm, fearless officer. I, as adjutant, was instructed
by Colonel Wayne to ride along the line
and to tell the men to fall back slowly before the
overpowering forces of the enemy. In returning
to my post beside the colonel, as was my duty, I
had the narrowest escape from death or capture
that occurred to me during the entire war. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
aware of the great danger I was incurring as I
swiftly galloped back in front of our skirmish line
along the public road to rejoin Colonel Wayne.
As I emerged from the pines along the road, riding
very swiftly, suddenly I came upon two or three
of the enemy's skirmishers who had been firing
at Colonel Wayne. I came into the main road a
few steps ahead of these men. I pulled up my
horse and suddenly turned to the left and at the
same instant the men threw up their guns and fired.
By reason of my sudden turn I feel satisfied that
the balls all went in front of me. As I rode down
the open road a dozen or more skirmishers had
some nice target practice at me, but they did very
poor shooting. A cup was cut from my haversack,
I think my hair was touched, and my horse was
skipped by a ball. We arrived at the bridge&mdash;with
a large body of enemy skirmishers about
fifty yards behind us.</p>

<p>The bridge, a wooden-covered structure, had
been saturated with turpentine and rosin by a
squad of our men who had instruction to burn it
as soon as we had crossed&mdash;I was among the
last to cross. The bridge was then smoking and
burning, I remember being partly stifled with
smoke as I entered, with difficulty forcing my
horse through. The bridge burned like tinder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a few minutes after we were across the flames were
fifty feet high.</p>

<p>After we had marched a few hundred yards, our
regiment received orders to return to the bridge
and see that it was entirely destroyed. I never
saw a better exhibition of discipline and courage
than was shown by our tired men. With no protection,
and only a narrow river separating them,
they turned to face a force ten times their number.
Fortunately there was a natural entrenchment by
the river into which we filed and which fully protected
us from the enemy's fire across the river.
Our situation was changed&mdash;the heavy line of
enemy skirmishers was along the open river and
our men who had been so long pursued were
protected, so we had our revenge.</p>

<p>My brother Tomlinson, was stricken with a
most acute case of inflammatory rheumatism and
had to be carried by his men, as he did not wish to
be left to fall into the hands of the enemy. After
we had crossed into North Carolina I managed to
have him sent in a wagon to Raleigh where he
was taken care of by a kind lady, Mrs. Polk, until
his recovery.</p>

<p>I asked our commanding colonel that I be relieved
from my position as acting adjutant, and
that I be assigned to command of Company L,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
my brother's company. It now had no commissioned
officer. My request was complied with.
Colonel R. A. Wayne called a meeting of the officers
of the regiment and proposed that on my
being relieved of my position that the thanks
of the regiment be given to me. It was agreed.
The regiment was drawn up in line of battle, arms
were presented, and in the language of the order&mdash;"Thanks
are returned to Lieutenant Fort for his
coolness and courage under fire." I was much
gratified at this compliment. I have the paper
written in pencil by Colonel Wayne, and have
preserved it for my children so as to show them
that their father did not lose his presence of mind
in times of great danger, and that they are the
children of a Confederate soldier.</p>

<p>General Hardee's brigade was now joined to the
army of General Joseph E. Johnston. At Bentonville,
North Carolina, Johnston gathered together
what forces he could, and fought the last great battle
of the war. It was a bloody, indecisive battle,
and ought never to have been fought. We were
confronted with a force over four times our superior
in number and ten times in equipment. No valor
or strategy could overcome such immense odds.</p>

<p>On the evening of the last day our rifle pits on
the extreme angle in front of our main line were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
captured. To recapture them a detail of ten men
from each company in the brigade was made and
I was detailed to lead it. It appeared a very
hazardous undertaking, but we retook the pits
with but little loss. I was the third man in the
pits. At midnight our army retreated across the
river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FACSIMILE OF THE COMPLIMENTARY ORDER
ISSUED BY COLONEL WAYNE</p></div>
</div>

<p>As soon as we had a safe distance between us and
the enemy, an order came to send an officer from
our division to Georgia to collect all soldiers possible
and bring them to the army. This order
was given to our regiment. Every officer except
myself applied for the place. Colonel Wayne was
indignant at so many applications, and ordered me
to go. I at once made quick preparations to leave
for Georgia. I had written orders signed by the
adjutant-general of General Joseph E. Johnston's
army for all authorities to forward me on my
journey with all means in their power. I was
aided some by the railroads, but I mostly depended
upon walking, carrying a knapsack weighing
twenty-nine pounds. On my journey through the
Carolinas and Georgia I witnessed many scenes
and incidents, some of an amusing, others of a
pathetic nature. I made a remarkably quick
trip. A day or so after I left the army a reorganization
was made of our division. Our regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was raised to over one thousand men. Although
not present I was advanced to senior first lieutenant
of the regiment. Many officers were put back
into the ranks.</p>

<p>While on the road I heard of the surrender of
General Lee. It seemed unbelievable, and I denied
the report. I arrived in Macon two days
before its capture by General Wilson. An organization
of cavalry was hastily formed in which I
was to receive an independent command and join
General N. B. Forrest in Alabama. But before
this could be accomplished in quick succession
came General Johnston's surrender, the capture
of President Davis, and the death of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Stonewall Jackson defined war
as "Death." General Sherman as "Hell." Whatever
may be its definition it is always unjustifiable,
inhuman, barbarous; the cause has nothing to do
with the issue of the conflict. Success attends
the side with resources sufficient to overcome their
opponents. For the last year of the war it was the
pure white flame of patriotism which alone sustained
the Confederacy,&mdash;its material resources
were exhausted. No valor, however great, could
withstand the resources of the North sustained by
immigrants from Europe. The frown of civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was upon the institution of negro slavery
and it had to go.</p>

<h2>AFTER THE WAR</h2>


<p>When I returned from the army I had a severe
cough and was in a very run down condition.
Brother George feared that I had an incipient case
of tuberculosis. So in the fall of 1865 I went down
to a plantation in Sumter County to try to recover
my health by living out of doors. That winter
I lived the life of a hunter, the gun constantly in
my hand. During the four years of the war the
game had not been hunted at all, consequently it
had increased in great abundance. I was very successful
in killing game of all kinds&mdash;quail, ducks,
wild turkey, and deer. To show the abundance of
the game, and my success, I remember that in
fourteen turkey hunts I brought home a turkey
every time but one. There were several large
ponds in the place to which the ducks, principally
mallards, came in great flocks to roost. One late
afternoon I saw two trumpeter swans coming in
to a pond. From a distance of one hundred and
forty yards I raised my rifle and shot one of them
dead. It was a magnificent bird, weighing thirty-nine
pounds and measured nine feet from tip to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
tip of the wings. There were coon hunts at night,
and many hours spent with the fishing rod. On
many of the trips I was accompanied by a faithful
negro named Squash. My health improved, my
cough disappeared, and I went back to Macon a
well, strong man.</p>

<p>In 1864 my sister Julia, Mrs. E. D. Huguenin of
Macon, then a widow, died as a result of a runaway
accident. She left five children to my mother's
care. She bequeathed to my mother her home
and servants in Macon, and made brother George
executor of the estate. The family then moved to
Macon, where we lived for about twenty years.
The family life was a most harmonious one. The
household was presided over by my mother,
assisted by sister Kate.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1866 brother George died. He
had been in poor health for a long time, but, in
spite of that, he had made a splendid success of his
profession, and had acquired a good deal of property.
He was the kindest and best of brothers.
After brother George's death I applied for testamentary
letters for the administration of the
Huguenin estate. The letters were granted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
bonis non cum testamentor nexus</i>. The estate
consisted principally of three large plantations in
Sumter County. At Colonel Huguenin's death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there had been about three hundred slaves. I
assumed the position of manager of the estate,
which occupied most of my time for many years.
When I took charge the estate owed about twenty
thousand dollars to Mrs. Rosa E. Delony, Athens,
Georgia, a daughter of Colonel Huguenin by a
former marriage. I succeeded with great effort
in paying off this indebtedness, although the
extreme low price of cotton and the contraction
of the currency made the payment very difficult
to make. Some years I was not able to make
any at all. At one time attempts were made to
sell the plantations at public sale. But I managed
to pull through. My commission for administrator
averaged about eight hundred a year.</p>

<p>I resumed the study of law under the tutelage
of Mr. L. N. Whittle in 1866, and I was duly
admitted to the Bar in the following year. On
account of the fact that the Sumter County plantations
kept me so busy, I was only able to devote
a limited amount of time to the practice of law.
I was reasonably successful in my profession.
I had a good clientage who felt that their affairs
were in safe hands. Some of my cases involved
interesting questions of law, several being taken
to the Supreme Court. I believe my greatest
triumph was the case of Mrs. Martha F. Woodson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<i>versus</i> Bodeing &amp; Company, in which the
opposing counsel was Mr. Benjamin H. Hill, in
which I achieved a great victory. I retired from
the practice of law in 1885 and turned my entire
attention to agriculture.</p>

<p>During my life in Macon I was interested in
the welfare of the city. Under the auspices of
the Ladies' Memorial Association, I erected the
Confederate monument which is standing to-day
at the crossing of Cotton Avenue and Mulberry
Street.</p>

<p>My niece, Martha Huguenin, married Mr. J. Marshall
Johnston of the firm of R. T. Wilson &amp; Co.,
bankers of New York City. Mr. Johnston and I
purchased large plantations in Houston, Lee, and
Dougherty counties, twelve thousand acres in all.
The title was conveyed to me and Mrs. M. F.
Johnston. The affairs of the Huguenin estate being
now wound up I could give most of my time
to agriculture on the newly acquired plantations.
The price of cotton continued very low. I do not
think at that time any one made money planting
cotton.</p>

<p>At just about that time the cotton caterpillar
appeared in the fields of southern Georgia and bid
fair to destroy the crop. Cotton growing seemed
doomed as a profitable undertaking. One day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
while out in the fields I noticed that the moths, the
parents of the cotton caterpillar, were flying very
slowly, as if sick. I captured some of these moths
and took them back with me to Macon, where with
the aid of a compound microscope I discovered
they were infested with a parasitic insect. This
parasite killed them in a short time. I, at once,
communicated this discovery to the Entomological
Department in Washington. But they refused
to agree with me in this, the true reason for
the quick disappearance of the cotton caterpillar.
Although I had testimony that the same trait of
slow short flight was noticed in the moths all over
the country, I do not know if any credit has ever
been given to my discovery by the Department, or
how they finally accounted for the disappearance
of the caterpillar from the cotton fields.</p>

<p>In the year 1876, a society for the promotion
of agriculture was formed, with headquarters in
Washington City. The organization spread with
astonishing rapidity, the farmers looking to it for
assistance. At a general meeting in Atlanta of
the Georgia organization, of which I was a member
and officer, a resolution was passed requesting the
legislature to form a Department of Agriculture.
I was requested to prepare a bill. I had no guide
before me; but I drew the bill, defining its object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in various matters, and giving the commissioners
power to prescribe rules, and to prohibit the sale
of worthless fertilizers in this State. I handed the
bill to Mr. Bacon, speaker of the House, and it
was introduced by Mr. Butt of Marion County.
The bill passed without amendment after much
discussion, and was soon a law. A similar bill
was passed almost at once by several other States.</p>

<p>Among the plantations in the western part of
Dougherty County, purchased by Mr. Johnston
and myself in 1879, was a body of land of twenty-five
hundred acres known as "Hickory Level."
The land was very fertile, there was no superior in
that entire section of the State. The plantation
was very sickly, no white man but one had ever
lived on it for two consecutive years. Malaria in
its worst form was very prevalent. The death rate
among the negroes was alarming. At that time,
the theory of the relation of the mosquito to the
spreading of malaria had not been advanced. I
considered the sickness to be due to a great extent
to the very bad water, being what is known as
"rotten limestone," which was drunk on the place.
The question of obtaining pure water became so
important that at one time it looked as though the
place would have to be abandoned if some solution
were not found. I thought first of building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
large cisterns with sheds to catch rain water, but
that plan involved so many details, and expense,
and there was the danger of easy contamination,
so I gave up that plan. I suggested then that we
bore an artesian well, as I had been investigating
that subject and believed that a well could be bored
with success. The question was discussed between
Mr. Johnston and myself but held in abeyance on
account of the expense and the uncertainty of the
enterprise.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1880 there was a great
deal of sickness on the place. There was very
little rain. Water was difficult to obtain and was
of a milky color. During that summer I tried to
interest the town of Albany and the Central of
Georgia railroad in the enterprise of boring an
artesian well to obtain good water. At that time
Mr. Nelson Tift, Sr., was Mayor of Albany; General
W. S. Holt was president and Mr. Shelman
superintendent of the Southwestern railroad. As
best I could, I laid before these gentlemen, the
importance of good water to that section and
what the benefit would be to the town of Albany
and to the railroads. I explained why I
believed artesian wells could be bored with success
in this section. And as I felt financially unable
to undertake the experiment of the first well, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
wished to get financial assistance for the undertaking
from those who would ultimately be benefited.
I received no encouragement. I wrote articles for
the <cite>Macon Telegraph</cite> and the <cite>Albany News and
Advertiser</cite>, explaining fully my reasons for believing
that artesian wells could be bored in southern
Georgia. My theories were ridiculed, and received
no serious attention.</p>

<p>At last, I determined to commence the undertaking
myself. I had the consent of my partner,
Mr. J. M. Johnston. We were jointly to bear
the expense. I again laid the matter before the
managers of the Central and Southwestern railroads
for assistance. I saw Mr. Shelman in person.
All he would do was to give me a free ticket over
the Southwestern road for the man whom I had
engaged to commence the well. This amounted
to three dollars and fifty cents, which was all the
assistance I received from the railroads, and that
was done in anticipation of the freight charges
that were to be on the engine and other material
that were to be brought from Selma, Alabama, to
Ducker Station for the purpose of boring the well.
I had written to a friend in Selma, Mr. J. C.
Campton, to recommend to me a man who was
accustomed to boring artesian wells in that section
of Alabama. He employed for me a Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Jackson from Selma at the price of five dollars
a day, for his services, and use of his friction clutch
and windlass. I purchased an engine and steam
pump and commenced work on February 1, 1881.</p>

<p>My reasons for the faith I had in the practicability
of artesian wells being bored in Georgia was
a matter of thought and observation extending
from my boyhood. One day while riding in a
buggy with my father in the lower part of Baldwin
County, we crossed a little stream known as
"Reedy Creek," that flowed over many small
round pebbles that looked like birds' eggs. The
banks, too, of the stream were covered with these
round stones imbedded in the earth. I got out of
the buggy to get some to carry home as checker
rocks for my sisters. My father then explained
to me, that at an ancient period of time this had
been the shore of the ocean that had extended over
what is now southern Georgia, south of a line
drawn from Augusta to Columbus. I was interested
in the facts explained to me by my father,
and remembered the conversation.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards while on the southern
Chattahoochee River I noticed cut by the river
bank a stratum of blue earth, which I felt assured
was an ocean deposit known as blue marl, a deep-sea
ooze. This ooze is impervious to water, preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the water underneath from rising to the surface
in springs. I noticed this deposit on the west
bank, the Alabama side, and that it was sloping
downward, eastward, and toward the south. I
crossed over to the east bank, the Georgia side,
none was to be seen. But the natural supposition
was that it was there only lower than the river
bank. This was near Eufaula. As this marl
appeared again at the surface near Brunswick, I
took what seemed to me to be a logical position
that this deposit extended under all southern
Georgia, far down in the earth.</p>

<p>There were other phenomena I had observed
on this subject. During the Civil War, I was
attached to a cavalry scout service with headquarters
near Saint Mark's, Florida. One day
I went with a comrade, Jim Denham, in a skiff
up the Wakulla River to the Wakulla Spring,
about five miles from Saint Mark's. This spring
is said to be the largest in the world. It is a great
natural curiosity. Here was a river as large as
the Chattahoochee or larger, rising up out of the
ground. Whence came this water? The natural
answer seemed: an underground river flowing
under Georgia, which had been prevented
before from rising to the surface by some natural
obstruction, namely, earth impervious to water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The water had sunk into the earth in the northern
plateau and mountains of Georgia, where there
were no water-tight strata. I was greatly awed
and interested in the Wakulla Spring. At first my
ideas of its origin were only vague and crude, but
became more definite and crystallized as time went
on, and as I added to my observation and thought
on the subject.</p>

<p>There had been several attempts to bore artesian
wells in Georgia. In about 1850 an attempt
was made to bore a well in Albany; which proved
a complete failure. They were wanting in continuous
pipes to reach water-tight strata. The
water would seep out and never reach the surface.
Mr. Jones of Newton, Georgia, was the contractor
for the Albany well. I wrote to him upon the subject.
He answered with a most discouraging
letter, stating that when a young man he had lost
a good deal of money in that enterprise, which he
had never been able to recover from the town of
Albany. Another attempt was by a Mr. Walker,
called "Rich Billy Walker," a very wealthy man
of Pulaski County, who bored two wells near
Longstreet, Georgia, both of which were failures,
although he went over six hundred feet deep.</p>

<p>My attention was also called to the fact that
scientists and especially the famous geologist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Joseph Le Conte, had said that artesian water
could not be procured in Georgia. In the face of
all this discouragement I am astonished that I
was still determined to go ahead, and too my
finances were very low. In after years, in thinking
this over, I have sometimes felt that I was
compelled to continue the undertaking by some
power outside of myself.</p>

<p>Commencing February 1, 1881, I continued the
work through the spring and summer. My tools
were so inferior that I almost had to abandon the
well, especially when a boring tool, a reamer was
broken off in the bottom of the pipe. My well
seemed to be a failure and was ridiculed by some
of the citizens of Albany. I remember one day
on the street that a Mr. Bazemore, a warehouseman,
stopped me and laughingly said that he had
an injunction against me, because I was trying to
rival Noah,&mdash;the difference was that Noah wished
to rescue from a flood while I wanted to flood
the State. Such ridicule only made me more than
ever determined to go on. With great difficulty I
succeeded in getting the reamer out. At about
the depth of four hundred feet I reached the water-tight
stratum, a deposit of deep-sea ooze known as
blue marl. I had been looking for this water-tight
envelope and felt greatly encouraged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 1st, I returned to Macon leaving
word to continue work until my return,
which would be within a few days. On August
4th, at ten o'clock in the morning I received
the following telegram, "Water flowing at seven
gallons per minute." I was greatly gratified at
this, which was a triumph for my belief and for
my perseverance. I took the next train accompanied
by Mr. Harry Edwards of the <cite>Macon
Telegraph</cite>. We arrived at Ducker Station the
next morning, Sunday, and went out at once to
see the little well. It was an inspiring and
gratifying sight to see the water flowing from
the pipe.</p>

<p>The country was in the grasp of a parching
drouth, and presented the appearance of a country
in a great need of the blessing of water. A great
number of awe-struck negroes had assembled.
They regarded me with great wonder and astonishment.
It was thought that the Almighty had
informed me to strike at that special spot, and I
was likened to Moses, who in the wilderness struck
the rock from which water gushed out. The news
spread. The well was visited by many people who
came to wonder and drink the splendid water.
An account of my success was published in many
of the State papers. The first being the <i>Macon
Telegraph</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> with an article by Mr. Edwards in
which I was much praised.</p>

<p>This gem of a little well, five hundred and fifty
feet deep, of the purest life-giving water, of less
than one hundred grains of any substance to the
gallon, flowed nineteen years without diminishing.
Its diminution at the end of this time was caused
by chemical corrosion of the pipe, a hole being
made, through which the water passed into the
great sand bed above the water-tight strata. I
successfully telescoped the pipe with a smaller
one. The well had only ceased to flow two or
three days.</p>

<p>My successful boring of this well was quickly
followed by the boring of others. The town of
Albany and the Central railroad bored two at
once, showing that they recognized the fact that
it would be of value to them. Soon there were
wells in Jacksonville and Sanford, Florida, and
Brunswick and Savannah, Georgia. Other places
quickly followed, getting their entire water supply
by this means.</p>

<p>Gradually the excitement occasioned by my
well died out. By many it was looked upon as an
accidental discovery and I was put in the list of
cranks. I believe that it even caused my credit
to suffer, for the banks of Albany, looking upon me
as a crank, refused to lend money to a visionary.
Nor has the Central of Georgia railroad, which more
than any corporation was benefited by my success,
ever acknowledged it in any way, or ever extended
to me any special courtesy. The boring of my
well, which cost eleven hundred dollars, was never
a help to me financially. But it was a great
satisfaction to me, to know that I was instrumental
in procuring the blessing of good water for
a great section of my native State, and to know
this has been recognized and praised by many.</p>

<p>During the first ten years my little well was used
by a large circle of the surrounding population who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
daily hauled barrels of water from the plantation.
No charge for this water was ever made. It was
free to all. It was a great satisfaction to me to see
how the health on the plantation was improved.
Malaria decreased, and hemorrhagic fever, the
great curse of the country, almost disappeared.
Pure water is a great preventive of sickness.</p>

<p>Times were hard, but I met all my pecuniary
obligations, although sometimes paying as high
as fourteen per cent. for money loaned on my real
estate as security, taking it as valued at one dollar
per acre.</p>

<p>I consider the year 1881 the brightest in my
life, as it contained two momentous happenings;
in August the boring of my artesian well, and in
October my marriage to Miss Lulah Hay Ellis of
Atlanta, which event was the most important in
my life.</p>

<p>I brought my wife to Macon where we lived
three years. I then gave up entirely my law practice,
and left Macon. I took my family, my wife
and two little daughters, to spend the winter
months on Cooleewahee, one of my plantations
near Albany. My wife became devoted to this
plantation. We lived a healthful and happy life in
the open. As game was plentiful, Lulah, with her
fishing rod, and I, with my gun, supplied our table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>I now return to my work with the water of south
Georgia.</p>

<p>During the boring of my artesian well we drilled
through a limestone stratum, eighty feet from the
surface to one hundred and ten. When this
stratum was reached all the water which could be
pumped down the pipe would disappear. I considered
this a strange thing. I inquired of contractors
in Albany and the neighborhood if they
had met with similar strata. They informed me
that they had. On receiving this information, I
felt confident that water let down into this stratum
from a pond would disappear. I became so interested
in this proposition that I determined to
make the experiment.</p>

<p>This section of Dougherty County is not over two
hundred feet above the sea level and has on it a
great many shallow ponds which have no natural
drainage and which, because of the flatness of the
land, cannot be drained by ditching. Near the
artesian well on my Hickory Level plantation
there was a pond of this character. It was not
over twelve feet deep and covered several acres
of ground. I thought that this stagnant water
contributed to the sickness of the place, and
to the high death rate from malaria. Later
scientific research concerning the mosquito has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
proved the connection of stagnant ponds and
malaria.</p>

<p>I determined to drain this pond into that subterranean
limestone stratum eighty feet below the
surface. I had a boat built and transported pine
logs to the center of the pond, laid them in a
square, building this up until it was above the
surface. I then had a platform put upon this
crib, connected a small derrick, made a large
swinging maul, and drove a three-inch pipe down
to the hard-rock stratum. I then attached a chisel
to a two-inch pipe which was let down in the three-inch
one and cut the rock by continually raising
it up and down, thus cutting through the rock
until we reached that honeycombed stratum which
I was looking for. When the chisel struck this
porous rock it fell about two feet. A large quantity
of air rose to the surface, startling the two negroes
who were working on the chisel. The top of my
three-inch pipe was several short pieces screwed
together. I now unscrewed and left open at the
bottom of the pond the three-inch pipe. The roar
of the water as it went into this subterranean cavity
sounded like a small cascade. The water in
the pond decreased gradually for about two weeks,
when it disappeared. The drained bottom presented
a remarkable sight&mdash;many fish, alligators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and trunks of ancient trees were exposed to the
sun.</p>

<p>This was a complete drainage and cost about one
hundred and fifty dollars. By preventing the pipe
from being stopped up with debris, the pond was
kept successfully drained for several years. But,
finally, through the difficulties of keeping it open,
as there were only negroes on the plantation, and
because of general inattention, the pipe became
stopped up and the pond filled again.</p>

<p>I would here like to state that to my knowledge
this method of subterranean drainage has been
taken advantage of, in several localities. One
that has been specially drawn to my attention is
the drainage with six pipes by Mr. T. F. Putney,
of Albany, of several hundred acres. This has
greatly increased the value of his land. There
are many ponds in south Georgia that I believe
could be drained in the same way, as I feel assured
that this same porous limestone stratum extends
under that entire section.</p>

<p>I believe that this method could be the answer
to the great problem of draining the Everglades
of Florida. That State is now spending
large sums of money on the attempt to drain parts
of these vast swamps by canals and ditches. I
believe that under this section of Florida is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
same geological formation as under Dougherty
County, Georgia, and into which could be drained
the surface water. And at only a fraction of the
cost of the system now being attempted.</p>

<p>I also hold the theory that the earth slides at
the Panama Canal could be remedied in the same
way, these slides being caused by very wet earth.
The geological formation at the Isthmus is volcanic,
resting on tertiary. Where the slides occur
is one hundred feet above sea level. I think that
a system of pipes, from the surface into a sand stratum
which runs under the Isthmus, would remove
the water from this wet earth. I shall not here go
into my theory in detail. I have suggested it to
Mr. Goethals, the engineer of the canal, and state
it here not only as a theory of mine, but as a prophecy
of the system that will ultimately be used.</p>

<p>As I became more and more convinced of
the immensity of the underground waterways of
Georgia, vast underground rivers making their way
to the sea, and as I realized more fully the inexhaustible
supply of good water to be obtained, I
had the vision of a large area of our State being
made more healthful because of pure water, and
prosperous by the use of that same water for the
irrigation of the land in the growing of crops.</p>

<p>I had always been interested in the problem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
irrigation. Many years ago, a Mr. H. S. Orme
moved from Milledgeville to Los Angeles, California.
When on a return visit of Mr. Orme,
I asked him what was the most wonderful thing
he had seen in the West. He replied that which
most impressed him was the fact that on a piece
of land watered by irrigation such splendid
fruit and vegetables were raised that it was
worth five hundred dollars an acre; adjoining
this tract was land which could be bought for
one dollar per acre because it could not be
reached by water. This showed the great value
of water, both pieces of land being of the same
fertility.</p>

<p>There is no section of Georgia that is arid, but
a large section of southern Georgia is subject to
prolonged summer drouths, when the crops burn
badly, sometimes being totally destroyed. It is
good land and with the help of commercial fertilizer
and water could make over one hundred bushels of
corn and two bales of cotton to the acre. This
section is geologically in the tertiary system and I
believe that in it artesian water is everywhere
obtainable.</p>

<p>I was so impressed with these facts and my belief
in the underground waters of the State was so
strong, that I determined, if I were ever financially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
able, to make a practical demonstration of what
could be done in this section by the help of irrigation
from an artesian well.</p>

<p>In late years, with much difficulty and limited
means, I have illustrated the truth of my theory.
I have, ten miles from Albany, a plantation known
as Tompkins. The land is good and well suited
to my purpose. On this plantation I determined to
make an irrigation plant. With difficulty, in spite
of accidents, I succeeded in boring a well five
hundred and fifty feet deep. From a pipe six feet
above ground there now flow thirty-five thousand
gallons per day. This now fills a reservoir which
holds four hundred thousand gallons. This reservoir
is about four feet above the field to be irrigated.
I was financially unable to make a cement
reservoir which would have cost between three and
four thousand dollars. I made a cheap substitute
of sand and clay at the cost of about one hundred
dollars. I plastered the sides and bottom of my
reservoir with sand and clay, and which I had
mixed by dragging a log back and forth across it.
The log acted as a trowel, and made the reservoir
perfectly water-tight.</p>

<p>This reservoir now irrigates a field of fourteen
acres. On this tract I have for the last three years
averaged per acre two bales of cotton, and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
one hundred and fifty bushels of corn, and over
four hundred bushels of fine onions.</p>

<p>Mr. Milo Williams, a United States irrigation
engineer, on looking over my plant, said that this
large section of Georgia was worth from three
hundred to five hundred dollars per acre, that is,
if the water supply was equal to what I believe it
to be, and if the availability of the water became
generally known. He said, too, that this land
compared favorably with lands that were selling
at that price in the irrigated section of the far
West. The United States Department of Agriculture
was interested in my work and gave me practical
advice on the irrigation of my field, but on
account of some technicality in the irrigation
appropriation I was given very little financial
assistance. I had hoped that the Department
would take up my idea and do some developing
on a large scale as they have done in the
West.</p>

<p>I wish again to state more fully my reasons for
my confidence in the possible development of the
underground resources of Georgia&mdash;a matter I
believe most important. There is a surface geological
formation called eocene commencing near
Dublin in Laurens County, extending in a southwesterly
direction through the counties of Pulaski,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Dooly, Sumter, Lee, Dougherty, Early, and
Decatur, across a narrow strip of West Florida.
I feel confident that under this formation flows
a great river with collateral branches which comes
to the surface at Wakulla Springs. Wherever
this eocene formation is clear and distinct I believe
an artesian well may be obtained, and that my
well taps that great underground river.</p>

<p>There are other underground waterways taking
different directions and different surface formation
that flow under southern Georgia and Florida.
There is a large quantity of fresh water that
comes up in the Gulf of Mexico near Cedar Keys,
Florida, another in the Atlantic Ocean at Sheep
Island, near Brunswick, Georgia. Brunswick has
excellent artesian wells.</p>

<p>I believe in the future this water power will be
developed for irrigation. It will not require much
capital, if the inexpensive furrow system of irrigation
is employed, and the well once obtained is
permanently there. I picture that part of the
State prospering with the raising of cereals and
cattle. There will be beautiful farms and comfortable
homes. Thus showing that adding water to
the other bounties of nature, this land can yield
abundant crops with the aid of the wisdom and
industry of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to my work in
fruit growing in northeast Georgia.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1886, we decided to spend the
summer months in the cool and healthful climate
of north Georgia. We bought a small cottage
in Mount Airy, Habersham County, where my
family have spent the subsequent summers. The
last fifteen years being spent in a large comfortable
home on the highest point in the village, with
magnificent views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and
surrounding country, and beautified with a profusion
of flowers with which my wife has great success.</p>

<p>In north Georgia my first work was with grapes.
In 1890 I bought some land near Mount Airy and
planted out a vineyard of Concords and Niagaras.
I raised splendid grapes. I have never seen their
equal, being superior in quality to those grown in
New York State. Our climate made them especially
sweet and tender. I did not make much
money with my vineyards as the prices were low
and express and commission so high. The grapes
were attacked by the black rot. I was unable to
eradicate it, although I tried the best means then
known to the United States Department of Agriculture.
So I was compelled to abandon the
cultivation of grapes on account of this disease
which became uncontrollable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>In my observation of the country around Mount
Airy I became satisfied that a large section of the
dividing ridge between the Chattahoochee and
Savannah rivers, on which ridge Mount Airy is
situated, was specially adapted to the growth of
peaches. My principal reason for this belief was
the freedom of this ridge from late frosts. This
absence of frosts is caused by oscillation of the
atmosphere&mdash;the cold air from the high lands
draining to the valley. Frost does not form when
the air is in motion. My theory that peaches
planted on these ridges are not killed by a late
frost has proved to be correct. I did not reckon
with the cold winds that swoop down on this section
from the northwest, the temperature going
very low, sometimes to zero, and killing the fruit
buds. This fall of temperature often comes after
comparatively warm weather, which had caused
the buds to swell. I determined to plant a peach
orchard on one of these ridges. In 1895 Mr. R. H.
Plant, of Macon, and I purchased some land splendidly
situated about three miles west of Mount
Airy. We planted about twenty acres in peaches.
This orchard is known as "Clear View." Later
I became the sole owner of this orchard. I also
planted orchards in the other side of Mount Airy.
I increased my orchards until I have one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and twenty acres in peaches&mdash;about twelve thousand
trees. I, at first, planted a good many varieties,
but my greatest success has been with Elbertas,
Georgia Belles, Crawfords, and Fox's Seedling. In
good seasons I have shipped from fifteen thousand
to eighteen thousand crates to markets at
Boston, New York, New Orleans, Cincinnati, and
Chicago. I have obtained net, as high as $1070
for a car, my peaches selling as high as $3.50
a crate in New York. But this was by no means
always the case. Some seasons on account of the
glutting of the market it hardly paid to ship.</p>

<p>The fruit is of great beauty, of large size and
bright color, and delicious flavor. My example has
been followed by many others, and now from
several miles above Mount Airy to Alto, ten miles
below, are hundreds of acres planted in peaches, as
many as six hundred cars being shipped out of this
section in one season. I believe as a whole the
growers have made money. Land has greatly
advanced in price. When I first put out my
orchard, ridge lands sold at two dollars per acre.
Now it is worth from fifty to one hundred and
fifty dollars.</p>

<p>It has been very gratifying to me to see an industry,
in this section in which I was the pioneer,
flourish and bring prosperity to the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
During peach season as much as thirty thousand
dollars are paid out for labor alone.</p>

<p>I now wish to speak of another experiment of
mine in fruit culture. Although this experiment
has not proved a financial success, it is of interest,
and I believe that yet through scientific work it will
be made a success. I speak of my cherry orchard.
My largest orchard of cherries is at Clear View. I
planted the large leaf variety of sweet cherry&mdash;the
large leaf protecting the tree from the sun, which
is too hot for them in this climate. I planted
a variety of Bigarreau cherries that holds its
leaves longer than most varieties. Though splendid
trees, and generally blooming profusely, there
is a lack of fertilization of the bloom, and what few
cherries are made fall before maturing. I believe
this condition is mostly due to the lack of moisture
at the season of blossoming. I now have some
ideas that may be able to correct this, and I believe
my cherry orchard will yet prove a success. Man
is made to overcome all obstacles.</p>

<p>I have been interested in the growing of many
kinds of fruits. I have large pear orchards on my
south Georgia plantations, Le Conte and Keifer
pears. The trees have been badly blighted but
have been a moderate financial success.</p>

<p>I now come to what I consider the most successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
undertaking of the latter part of my life&mdash;the
growing of apples in Rabun County, Georgia.</p>

<p>I shall begin with a few words on apple culture
in Georgia. Draw a line through our State from
Augusta through the cities of Milledgeville and
Macon to Columbus, and we will note at these
cities that our rivers break over the granite rocks,
and from thence flow gently to the ocean. Below
this primary geological formation is nearly two-thirds
of the area of our State, none of which is
more than five hundred feet above sea level. This
large area is classed as tertiary, and presents a
soil and climate in which the apple has never been
successfully grown.</p>

<p>Immediately north of this line we come to the
granite formation known as primary&mdash;comprising
a large portion of the State, in which are included
the red hills of Georgia. In this section certain
classes of apples succeed well. This type may be
illustrated by the Red June and Horse apple for
summer; and the Yates and Terry's Winter for
winter. These apples succeed better the higher
altitude we reach in this primitive area of the State.
They seem to approach a higher degree of perfection
as the altitude above sea level increases.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that climate and altitude
above the sea level are the two most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
factors in successful apple-growing in the State
of Georgia.</p>

<p>We will now consider that area of our beloved
State from which arise the headwaters of our
streams that flow into the Atlantic and Gulf.
This is termed the mountain section, and embraces
that portion of Georgia lying from 1800 to
3000 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>To go back to the beginning of my interest in
this question,&mdash;I moved in the fall of 1898 to
Demorest, a few miles from Mount Airy, for the
winter months, for the purpose of putting my children
in school, Demorest having good educational
advantages.</p>

<p>Through Demorest there used to pass covered
wagons full of apples on their way from the mountains
to Athens. I was struck with the beauty
of these apples, especially with an apple called the
"Mother" apple which was capable of a very high
polish and very free from blemish. On talking to
the wagoners I found that they came down from
Rabun County, Georgia, and near Shooting Creek,
North Carolina, and that they grew their apples
with very little care or cultivation. I was so
interested that I went up to Rabun to study
the apple question. I applied for the government
meteorological maps of this section. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was struck by its heavy rainfall. An area of
about thirty miles square with the center at Clayton,
Rabun County, and extending into North
Carolina, has the largest rainfall of any part
of the United States, except Puget Sound on
the Pacific Coast&mdash;a rainfall averaging from
seventy to one hundred inches per annum. This
does not come in floods, but all through the year
in continual showers. I have often stood in Rabun
Gap and been struck with wonder at the
mist being drawn through Rabun, Hiawassee, and
Crow Gaps, forming clouds laden with moisture
to be deposited upon the mountains and vales of
this favored country. They often present scenes
of sunshine and clouds so inspiring and grand that
they seem to encircle us with the majesty of Almighty
Power. This rain upon a well-drained
soil is very adaptable to the growth of splendid
apples. On seeing what fine apples could be
grown without cultivation, one naturally asked
what could not be done with modern scientific
culture. I wished very much to plant an orchard
in that favored section. At first I tried to interest
persons with capital in this enterprise, which I felt
confident would be a profitable investment. I met
with no success so, in spite of my limited resources,
I determined to make the venture myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuance of my long contemplated desire,
I purchased in 1906 fifty acres of land near Rabun
Gap in northeast Georgia, for the purpose of
planting an apple orchard. The position chosen
was within a mile and a half of Rabun Gap, on
the Tallulah Falls railroad. The place was
known as Turkey Cove, situated on Black's Creek
which forms the headwaters of the Tennessee
River. There were upon the place about fifty
apple trees that had been planted fifteen or twenty
years. They were overgrown with wild vines, and
presented a very neglected appearance. I had the
old trees cared for and I planted a young orchard
of twelve hundred trees of approved varieties of
apples. The young apple trees I planted grew, and
the old trees responded to the care given them.
After the first year's care and cultivation, I noticed
in the old orchard four trees that produced
a red apple that surprised me with its splendid
appearance. They ripened about November 1,
1908.</p>

<p>About this time I received by mail a pamphlet
stating that there was to be held at Spokane,
Washington, the first National Apple Show. A
prize was offered for the best two barrels or six
boxes of apples grown in the sixteen Southern
States. This prize was called the "Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
States Special" and was divided into first, second,
and third prizes. I decided to send six boxes of
my apples to contest for the "Southern States Special."
I had about twenty-five bushels from the
four trees. I shipped six boxes by express. In
return I received a check for $50 for the second
best apples&mdash;North Carolina receiving the first
prize, my apples the second, and apples from
Oklahoma the third prize.</p>

<p>Being elated with my success I had my four
apple trees specially cared for. On November
1, 1909, they presented an appearance superior to
any similar sight I had ever beheld. The National
Apple Show was again held in Spokane in
November, 1909. I again contended for the first
prize, "Southern States Special," with superior
apples to my entry in 1908. They were awarded
the first prize of $100 above all competitors. The
chairman of the committee making the award is
the most renowned pomologist in our county&mdash;Mr.
H. E. Van Deman, of Washington, D. C.
I obtained also a diploma for the best new variety
of apples.</p>

<p>The cancelled check of one hundred dollars for
this prize was applied for by a trustee of Mr.
Ritchie's school, near Rabun Gap, and is now
framed and hung upon the schoolhouse wall, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
remind the children that their county can produce
the best apples.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">AWARDED TO JOHN P. FORT FOR APPLES GROWN IN
RABUN COUNTY, GA., "FORT'S PRIZE APPLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>This apple, having been pronounced a new
variety and worthy of being put upon the pomological
books at Washington, was listed and given
the name of Fort's Prize. The apple has demonstrated
those qualities that make a financial success,
such as appearance, color, taste, and above
all, keeping without decay until the spring.</p>

<p>Anticipating that an orchard of this new variety
of apple will be valuable, I have obtained grafts
from the old trees and have put out an orchard of
them. I have a confident hope and belief that this
variety of apples will become very valuable in
future to apple growers, and that they will become
money-makers, such as the Baldwin and Ben
Davis are among apples; the Elberta peach, among
peaches; the Concord grape, among grapes. It
originated in Georgia. I am gratified that I
brought it to public attention.</p>

<p>This season, 1916, my orchard at Turkey Cove
has an abundant crop of splendid apples, and I
hope in the next few months to harvest a crop of
two thousand bushels. I have just returned from
a visit to my orchard, and it presents a beautiful
sight. My youngest son, William, has the active
management of my orchards.</p>

<p>There are now thousands of acres planted in
this section of the State, and it bids fair to be one
of the most profitable of Georgia's industries&mdash;an
industry attributable in a great way to my
success.</p>

<p>I now wish to write a few words on my interest in
the culture of pecans. When a boy in Milledgeville,
in the year 1849, my aunt, Mrs. Moses Fort,
widow of my father's brother, returned from a visit
to one of her sons in Louisiana. She brought with
her a little sack holding about a quart of pecans.
She divided them among my father's children, my
share being about twelve. The others ate theirs,
but I planted mine in the back of the garden, marking
the places with stakes from my bird trap.
They came up that spring and some of them are
now immense trees, sixty feet tall and bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
bushels of pecans. As far as I know these are the
oldest pecan trees in the State of Georgia. About
thirty years ago I planted a small pecan orchard
on Tompkins plantation. They were not budded
and were a poor variety, and for many years they
were neglected. But about three years ago I had
them budded and I believe that in a few years they
will yield a profitable crop. The pecan industry
in Georgia bids fair to be a very large one, as
hundreds of acres have been planted.</p>

<p>My belief in the agricultural possibilities of
Georgia is so great, especially in the growing of
fruits, that I wish to mention all my work in this
line, the successful experiments and the ones that
have not yet, from one cause or another, proved
successes, such as my cherries in north Georgia,
and my experiment with figs in south Georgia.
The latter proved a failure because of the avidity
and lack of coöperation of the railroads. Figs
are too perishable to stand shipping. I wished to
can the figs in glass jars at the orchard, but the
freight rates on fruit in glass jars were so high and
as there was no local market I abandoned the
orchard. It would have proved a difficult undertaking
anyway as I could not be in that section at
the time and the work would have lacked the
master's eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one more experiment in agriculture that
I wish to mention which has been a success. I
thought of growing vegetables in north Georgia
to ship to Florida after its crop was over. So I
planted half an acre in tomatoes to be shipped
to Savannah and Jacksonville. The railroads
considered shipping vegetables to southern points
such an uncertain and foolish thing that they
required me to give bond on the freight. My
experiment was a great success, the commission
merchant, Mr. Putzel, of Savannah, wrote me
that in his twenty-seven years of experience he
had never handled such stock. The half-acre
netted me one hundred and fifty-nine dollars.
My example has been followed by others, and
vegetables are now being shipped in considerable
quantities from Cornelia to south Georgia and
Florida markets.</p>

<p>In June, 1909, when in Athens to attend the
graduation of two of my sons, as an appreciation
of my work for the State agriculture, I had conferred
upon me by the University of Georgia,
the degree of "Doctor of Science." That the
trustees of the University contemplated this was
entirely unknown to me. This honor was conferred
before a large audience and was very
gratifying.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>My irrigation plant in south Georgia having
proved a success, the Department of Agriculture
at Washington sent a special irrigation engineer
to Tompkins plantation to make a report. Such
a good report was made that the Department conferred
upon me the title of Collaborator of Irrigation,
giving me a diploma stating this fact.</p>

<p>As I stated near the beginning of this story of my
life, I believe that my mind and temperament are
those of a naturalist. From my boyhood my
interest in birds has never abated. I know their
habits, I can distinguish the notes of all the birds
of our woods and recognize them by their flight
as far as my eyes can see.</p>

<p>This spring (1916) while seated on the porch of
our home, at Mount Airy, I have succeeded with
great patience and with the enticing power of the
peanut, in getting a gray-crested titmouse to light
on my hand, and to take a peanut from between
my lips. And I persuaded a nuthatch to come
within a foot of my chair. The titmouse knew me
so well that when I was several hundred yards from
the house it flew down from a tall tree and took a
peanut from my hand. This was in the season
when food was plentiful.</p>

<p>As an agriculturist as well as naturalist I have
been always interested in the insectivorous birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as a great aid to man in the destruction of insects.
I know of no bird that does not eat insects, except
the goldfinch. I remember once examining the
stomach of an American swift, it contained a
mass of insects, six hundred and fifty mosquitoes
and gnats which had been caught on the wing that
day. Especially valuable is the purple martin
because he can be attracted to our fields and
orchards if the proper kind of house is made for
him. He arrives from the tropics very early in
time to meet the first flight of many noxious
insects such as the cuculio which is so destructive
to the peach and similar fruits.</p>

<p>When I built for irrigation my reservoir holding
four hundred thousand gallons, I was afraid that
it would be a great breeding place for mosquitoes.
I placed around the reservoir boxes and gourds on
poles as homes for the purple martin, so that the
birds would destroy the mosquitoes. At the same
time I had put in the water small fish to eat the
wiggletails, the larvæ of the mosquito. The fish
and martins have largely eradicated this noxious
insect from the plantations.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Acknowledgment of Mr. Fort's observations on mosquitoes
has been made in <cite>The Mosquitoes of North and Central America
and West Indies</cite>, pages 178, 403, vol. i. Authors: Leland O.
Howard, Harrison G. Dyar, Frederick Knabe.</p></div>

<p>At the present time the boll weevil has made its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
appearance in most of the cotton fields in southwest
and middle Georgia. I believe that the
ravages of the weevil cannot be stopped, but they
can be checked and reduced to a minimum. In
studying the history of this insect, I find that it is
food for birds of the class hirundo, or swallow.
When the boll weevil, which is one of cuculio,
makes its first flight over the cotton fields before
depositing its eggs in the cotton squares is the
time that it is caught by the swallows and martins.
The weevil is slow in flight and easily caught.
If the first brood is caught it will decrease them
by the million, as it has been calculated that the
progeny of one female, if not destroyed, would
by the end of the season be two million. I have
had placed around my cotton fields forty martin
boxes. I am confident that these birds will greatly
lessen the depredation of the boll weevil in my
fields. As the martin returns every year to the
same home, each year I hope to have a larger
colony.</p>

<p>We must protect the birds. A great French
savant has said that in seven years, without the
help of insectivorous birds, the world would become
uninhabitable by man. The destruction of
insects is greatest during the nesting season of
the birds, as a young bird is a small mill continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
grinding up insects. Birds should have our special
protection at that season. A young bird just
off the nest is a prey to almost everything; cats,
hawks, snakes, are among its principal enemies.
The wanton destruction of bird life by man has so
decreased them that it threatens the world with a
great calamity. We must teach the young generation
to refrain from this destructive work, and
that the birds are our useful friends. Teach them
to love the birds, to admire their plumage and
song, to study their habits, and to realize that they
contemplate the work of a munificent Creator who
has fashioned these beautiful inhabitants of the
air.</p>

<p>I now bring to a close these brief reminiscences
of a long life, dictated to my daughter at her
request. They are for my six children, being a
short record of the life and work of their father.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM THE NEWSPAPERS IN
THE STATE OF GEORGIA</h2>


<h3><cite>The Macon "Daily Telegraph," Saturday Morning,
May 11, 1907</cite><br />

<span class="smcap">By John T. Boifeuillet</span></h3>

<p>Speaking of John P. Fort reminds me that to
him is due the credit of introducing artesian wells
in southwestern Georgia, where he owned large
farming lands. He desired to protect and improve
the health of his tenants and other laborers
by freeing them from the necessity of drinking the
rotten limestone water in shallow wells which was
considered productive of chills, fever, and other
sickness. So this progressive Maconite decided
to experiment with artesian wells and he had one
bored on one of his plantations from which a
splendid flow of fine water was obtained. The
result was so gratifying that he had other wells
bored and the health of the people on his farms
became first class. The glad news was spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
throughout all that section of country, and other
planters followed Captain Fort's example, and in a
short time the boring of artesian wells became common
in that territory. An official publication says
that the sanitary advantages that have resulted
to many towns and localities all over the southwest
Georgia coastal plain through the pure,
wholesome drinking water of the artesian wells,
are seen in the fact that sections once dreaded as
malarial and sickly are now considered among the
most salubrious in the State and are increasing
more rapidly in population than even the hill
country of north Georgia. The average depth of
the wells in south Georgia is about four hundred
and fifty feet, and as the various strata penetrated
are comparatively free of rock, the wells are bored
at small cost. Bulletin No. 7 of the State Geological
Survey says: "While there is much yet to
be learned about the underground water system of
the coastal plain, there is, nevertheless, sufficient
known already to warrant the statement that
almost this entire portion of the State is underlaid
by pervious beds which will furnish large quantities
of pure, wholesome water when pierced by the
drill." When Captain Fort drilled his first artesian
well he bored better than he knew. The Maconite
became a public benefactor. Georgia is due him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
much for his foresight and progressiveness, his
philanthropy and humanity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">By Emory Speer</span><br />

<p>The observant people of Georgia have long been
aware of the blessings many enjoy through the
inducting philosophy of a distinguished and unpretentious
son of our State. Our university has
honored him and itself by the degree, Doctor of
Science. Dr. John P. Fort was the first who made
evident how practical and how beneficent are those
artesian wells whose copious and healthful supply
are now gushing in every community and on many
farms in that fertile empire known as South Georgia.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">By W. A. Huff</span><br />

<cite>The Albany "Herald," February 11, 1913</cite></h3>

<p>I never see or hear anything about the country
around and about Albany that I do not think of
Jno. P. Fort.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort, by his wise experiment and persistent
efforts, made it possible for white people to live
in a country which had heretofore been regarded
as almost uninhabitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Fort called on me as he passed through
Macon last week and on his way to his farm in
south Georgia. Like myself, he is rapidly yielding
to the weight of years as they carry him along
the down-hill of life, but oh, what a halo of business
glory will brighten and bless forever the memory
of southwest Georgia's greatest benefactor!</p>

<p>A grateful people will never be able to build a
monument high enough to signalize the debt they
owe to Jno. P. Fort. But as the good that men do
lives after them, all coming generations will breathe
out prayers of praise for him who made it possible
for their ancestors to know the eternal joys that
flow from the bosom of Mother Earth through the
life-giving arteries of artesian wells.</p>

<p>In the meantime you will continue to preach to
the farmers of Georgia the gospel of truth and

<h3><span class="smcap">Editorial</span><br />

<cite>The Clayton "Tribune," Friday, May 9, 1913</cite></h3>

<p>Col. John P. Fort, a graduate of Oglethorpe
College, and one of the men who first got a vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the future possibilities of Rabun County's
apples, was in Clayton, Wednesday. Colonel Fort
owns one of the finest orchards in the county at
Mountain City, and has done more in the way of
growing fine fruits and advertising northeast
Georgia, thereby enhancing the value of our mountain
lands, than any other one man. Colonel Fort
is now about seventy-one years of age, but is still
very active. He joined the Confederate army in
the beginning of the Civil War as a private, but was
promoted and at the close he came out with honors
and as a lieutenant. As Dr. Fort is able to talk
with nature, we might compare him with Benjamin
Franklin; he has been honored by our University
with the degree of Doctor of Science. Dr.
Fort was not satisfied with growing apples in northeast
Georgia (in Rabun County), which took the
prize in Spokane, Washington, at the great apple
show, and for the last year or so he has been
studying the conditions and needs of south and
southwest Georgia, and while he was on duty as a
Confederate soldier, he saw the beautiful Wakulla
River on the coast of Florida, as it bursts forth
into the Apalachee Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.
Dr. Fort's ability to reason and know things told
him that this beautiful clear river had its origin
away up in the "old red hills of Georgia," and last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
year he made another trip to see this great spring
or bay and to learn more about it. Dr. Fort
traced the formation and vegetation up through
Florida and on through the counties of Decatur,
Grady, Early, Miller, Baker, Mitchell, Calhoun,
Dougherty, etc., and he is satisfied that it heads in
the counties of Laurens, Twigg, and Bibb. Dr.
Fort owns a large plantation in Dougherty County,
containing some three thousand acres, and last
year he bored an artesian well on this farm about
seven hundred feet deep, at an expense of about
three thousand dollars, and not to his surprise,
but to the surprise of his neighbors, Georgia, and
our United States Government, he tapped the
undercurrent of the beautiful Wakulla River and
through a three-inch pipe, it has been estimated,
a flow of eighty thousand gallons per day can be
attained, and the expense of obtaining this flow
and building reservoirs from which to conduct the
waters to the crops is much cheaper in comparison
with any other method of irrigation known to
the world. This discovery by Dr. Fort will probably
make it possible for other such discoveries to
be made, and it has more than doubled the value
of the farming lands in south Georgia, which are
so subject to drouths. This theory of Dr. Fort's
is thoroughly demonstrated as the water of this well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
rises and falls with the Gulf tide and the water
is inexhaustible and his discovery is so highly
prized by the Irrigation Bureau of the Department
of Agriculture, that it has conferred upon Dr. Fort
the signal dignity of "Collaborator," and monthly
there comes and will come to him during his life
a treasury draft as a token from his country of its
government's appreciation and value of his discovery,
and the time is now here that not only
northeast and southwest Georgia will tip their
hats to Dr. Fort's name, but the whole nation
will recognize Dr. Fort's ability as a scientist, and
his name will go down to future generations as one
of America's greatest men.</p>


<h3><cite>Macon "Daily Telegraph," September 30, 1913</cite><br />

<span class="smcap">By James Callaway</span></h3>

<p>Colonel John P. Fort is one of the sure-enough
progressives of the State. His progressivism is not
destructive like that of the Western politicians,
but is of the sort that promotes the welfare of his
State. It is well-known that he gave to Georgia
her first artesian well. Albany followed his example
and became the "Artesian City," appropriate
sobriquet&mdash;for it is a city of artesian wells.</p>

<p>Some couple of years ago or more Colonel Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
decided to experiment with truck gardening
on his Dougherty County farm. He built a
huge reservoir for the purpose of irrigation.
Speaking of this a few evenings since, sitting on
the veranda of the Albany Inn, Colonel Fort said:</p>

<p>"I'm glad to say my experiment is a success.
Irrigation is not needed so much here as in the
West, still we have dry spells, and to make truck
growing a successful enterprise, I prepared for
seasons of dry weather. This year I will make
176 bushels of corn per acre in the range of the
reservoir, and I gathered onions until we were
fatigued gathering them and preparing for market.
And all other truck, such as beans, tomatoes, okra,
lettuce, salads, grew abundantly. After gathering
the onions the land was planted in corn, which is
now in the roasting ear stage, and at this season
roasting ears are in good demand. To prevent
mosquitoes from breeding in the reservoir, I put
into it fish, which destroy the larvæ, and also
erected martin poles with old-fashioned martin
gourds around the basin of water. Martins, you
know, feed on mosquitoes. On the ponds on my
place I pour kerosene oil, so the plantation is free
from mosquitoes&mdash;resulting in health for all on
the farm. Besides my manager after rains goes
through the quarters of the laborers and if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is any water in pans or cans or old vessels they are
emptied. Thus by a little precaution my plantation
is clear of mosquitoes.</p>

<p>"Then to assist in truck growing it is important
to conserve bird life. Every vegetable seems to
have its insect enemy. Nature provides its checks
and balances. But for years and years, reaching
back for nearly a century, we have been killing the
birds. They are here as nature's remedy to feed
upon insects. It will take years to restore nature's
balance which we have been upsetting by our war
on birds. Take the red-headed woodpecker, the
blue jay, the yellow-hammers, partridges, larks,
and the oriole family of birds, and they all feed
upon insects. The orioles are especially fond of
boll weevils, and it is said the blue jay and partridges
are very destructive of them. But we
destroyed nature's balance by indulging the pleasures
of sport. Had we conserved bird life&mdash;nature's
remedy&mdash;insects and boll weevils had not
been so destructive.</p>

<p>"Fortunately there is a nation-wide campaign
for the protection of birds. Congress has taken
hold of the matter and our new tariff bill prohibits
the importation of wild birds' plumage for commercial
purposes. It will also abolish in the
United States and its territorial possessions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
traffic in the skins and feathers of wild birds.
This national conservation of bird life, supplemented
by vigorous State action protecting our
home birds, will in time restore that balance nature
provided for preserving food crops and fruits
from insect ravages. It seems almost incomprehensible
that we destroyed nature's remedy for
protection to our crops. The unthinking will
continue to destroy our birds if not prevented by
the strong arm of the law."</p>

<p>It is always interesting to listen to Colonel Fort.
He is full of wisdom, and to be with him is as if
sitting at the feet of Gamaliel. He is deeply interested
in apple culture in Rabun County, but his
peach orchards around Mount Airy, his home, this
year did not bear to any great extent. In his
quiet, unassuming way Colonel Fort preaches diversification
of crops and raising home supplies,
and he, unlike most reformers, practices what he
preaches. His younger days were spent in Macon,
and he has great affection for Macon and is interested
in her progress and welfare.</p>


<h3><cite>The Albany "Herald," Tuesday, Feb. 13, 1917</cite><br />

News of the death of Colonel John P. Fort at
Tampa, Florida, where he was spending the winter,
will carry sadness to all parts of Georgia.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>For Colonel Fort was a distinguished citizen of
this State, and was widely known as a pioneer in
many fields of activity. He it was who bored the
first artesian well in Georgia. A great many men
laughed at him when he declared, after carefully
studying the geology of this section, that he would
sink a well to water-bearing strata several hundred
feet below the surface, and that through that well
purer water than the people of south Georgia had
ever drunk would flow to the surface. That
was thirty-five years ago, and Georgia's first
artesian well, bored on one of Colonel Fort's plantations
in Dougherty County, is still flowing. It is
a simple but eloquent memorial of the man whose
faith was not without works, and whom the ridicule
of those with shorter vision could not discourage.</p>

<p>To-day the health of no section of Georgia is
better than that enjoyed by the people in the region
of which Dougherty County is the geographical
center, and much of the credit for the present
splendid prosperity of southwestern Georgia is
due to the man who was not afraid to "invest
several thousand dollars in an auger hole in the
ground," as some wise observers expressed it
thirty-five years ago.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort has also been a pioneer in the field
of irrigation in this section. Several years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he publicly proclaimed the belief that a series of
inexhaustible water-bearing strata runs beneath
thousands of square miles of southwest Georgia
territory, and he predicted that in time these
strata would be tapped at many points, and drawn
upon for water which would make garden spots of
innumerable farming districts. He again showed
his faith in what he proclaimed by drilling another
artesian well on one of his Dougherty County
plantations, where he has constructed and operated
an irrigation plant that has given splendid
practical demonstrations of the possibilities of this
kind of agriculture in southwest Georgia.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort has also made valuable contributions
to the advancement of horticulture, and his
apple and cherry trees, in north Georgia, are famous
throughout the United States. He has raised
the finest apples ever produced in the South, and
several years ago the University of Georgia conferred
upon him the degree of Doctor of Science,
in recognition of what he had done for Southern
horticulture.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort was a gallant Confederate soldier,
and personally was beloved wherever he was
known, particularly in Albany, Macon, Atlanta,
Athens, and Mount Airy. His death is a distinct
loss to Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h3><cite>The Albany "Herald," Wednesday, Feb. 14, 1917.</cite><br />

<span class="smcap">What Colonel Fort Believed</span></h3>

<p>It was the belief of the late Col. John P. Fort
that much of southwest Georgia, including all the
western part of Dougherty County, would one
day blossom into a veritable garden spot as the
result of a peculiar natural condition.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort bored the first artesian well in this
section, and had made a lifelong study of the
geology of the southern part of the State. He
contended that a flowing artesian well might be
secured almost anywhere in this region, but it was
his belief that in the territory where he had made
especially careful investigations, including West
Dougherty, a vast water-bearing stratum, or perhaps
several such strata, lay below the surface
and that the supply of water held there could never
be exhausted. Many springs in south Georgia
and Florida, including the great Wakulla spring
and a number that boil up from the bottom of the
Gulf of Mexico, were fed from this stratum, according
to Colonel Fort's idea.</p>

<p>The picture in the mind of Colonel Fort, as he
often spoke of this rich blessing enjoyed by our
section, was of a region to the surface of which a
part of this water supply had been brought for use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in irrigation plants. He himself built such a plant
on one of his Dougherty County plantations, and
gave practical demonstrations of what it was
possible to accomplish. The United States Government
became interested in the experiment, and sent
experts to make observations and lend assistance.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort did not expect to live to see his
dreams come true, but he believed they would
materialize for other generations. He knew that
in the rich soil of this section wonderful crops
could be made under irrigation, and that with an
inexhaustible water supply a few hundred feet
below the surface, the development he foresaw
would in time come to pass.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort was no dreamer, though some
persons thought he was when he began boring the
first artesian well in Georgia. He lived to see
hundreds of flowing wells and thousands from
which pure water is pumped, and another generation
will no doubt see his vision of a section made
fabulously rich by irrigation likewise realized.</p>


<h3><cite>Macon "Telegraph," Feb., 1917</cite><br />

<span class="smcap">By James Callaway</span></h3>

<p>I received a letter from Mr. Alfred C. Newell
concerning a memorial to the memory of Col.
John P. Fort. The letter in part reads:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I note that John P. Fort, of Mount Airy, is dead.
I write you this because it seems to me a movement
should be initiated by some one to establish a
memorial to this great man. He would not want
a monument. He would be the last man in the
world to care for anything like display. It seems
to me, however, entirely fitting that a special
appropriation could be made by the board of
county commissioners of every county in south
Georgia to the end that a small mountain school
might be established somewhere about his beloved
Mount Airy.</p>

<p>"What William H. Crawford, Charles F. Crisp,
and Alfred H. Colquitt were to Georgia in a public
sense; what Sidney Lanier and Joel Chandler
Harris were to the State in a literary way; and
what Henry Grady was as an editor-statesman,
John P. Fort has been to Georgia as the practical
scientist.</p>

<p>"In other words, his name deserves to be perpetuated
in the immediate set of the biggest men
in the State's history.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am going too far when I say
that he probably did more for Georgia in a practical
way than any other one man. I have a
long letter from him which he wrote some years ago
telling me how he first came to think of drilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the original artesian well on his place near Albany.
This was in 1881. You know, of course, the
transformation which followed in this section.</p>

<p>"It was through his efforts that the apple culture
was introduced in the north Georgia mountains.</p>

<p>"He was a dreamer who dreamed dreams as
well as a scientist who knew how to work out these
dreams with a table of logarithms.</p>

<p>"His father before him was a great man, old
Dr. Tomlinson Fort&mdash;the greatest antebellum
physician of his day."</p>

<p>It is certainly appropriate that some steps be
taken at once to erect a memorial to Colonel Fort.
Nothing would be more fitting than a "mountain
school." It is better than brass or marble.
Mr. Newell has communicated his suggestion to
Editor Henry McIntosh, of Albany, and also to
Hon. Clark Howell.</p>

<p>The thought-forces worked strongly in Colonel
Fort, making him a centrifugal force, a builder
for humanity. He lived to see his visions become
realities&mdash;blessings to mankind. He felt the responsibility
resting upon him. He never permitted
his faith to trail, but walked uprightly,
full of good deeds and useful thoughts.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort was certainly the "practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
scientist." Albany is known as the "Artesian
City." Colonel Fort gave to Dougherty County
its first flowing artesian well. His apples from
the "hills of Habersham" and Rabun took the
premium over all others at the fairs of the
great Northwest.</p>

<p>Throw a rock into the air and by force of gravitation
it falls. Yet right in the face of that power
of gravitation, that life-giving principle called
sap, flows to the top of the tallest tree, resuscitating
its remotest branches. Colonel Fort's attempt to
discover flowing artesian water was likened by his
friends to the rock that falls to the ground. But
his thought-forces within, in the face of discouragement,
were like the ascending sap, bounding in
hope and carrying triumph and beauty and health
to every branch of his tree of endeavor.</p>

<p>Every flowing artesian well in Georgia is a never-ceasing
tribute to Colonel Fort&mdash;the "practical
scientist," as Mr. Alfred Newell calls him.</p>

<p>Colonel Fort drove mosquitoes from his Dougherty
County plantation by the simple device of
putting up martin-gourds and bird-houses at the
homes of his tenants. He had discovered that the
swallows and martins fed on mosquitoes, and determined
to locate them on his premises by building
little houses for them. On his recent visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Macon he told the writer, his countenance lighting
up with expressions of pleasure over his triumph,
that his experiment had been a success and that the
health of his tenants was excellent.</p>

<p>Two years ago he advised me to try the martin.
But the tenants considered martin-gourds a relic of
slavery times, and in their superstition would not
erect the martin-poles. Colonel Fort also said the
martins fed on boll weevils, and he expected to
largely increase the number of martin-houses.
And this was our last conversation, not many
weeks ago. Yes, he was like Colonel Hunt, of
Eatonton, "a practical scientist"&mdash;the most useful
of men.</p>

<h2>COLONEL JOHN P. FORT</h2>


<p>Editor the <cite>Journal</cite>: I notice in a recent issue
of the <cite>Journal</cite> the death of Colonel John P. Fort
at Tampa, Fla., on the 12th inst. His home was in
Mount Airy, Ga. In 1863 President Davis appointed
John P. Fort a lieutenant in the First
regiment of Georgia regulars, stationed at Hammocks
Landing on the Appalachicola River, in
Florida. The first time I saw Lieutenant Fort
under fire was at Lake City, Fla., on the 10th of
February, 1864. He was in command of the skirmish
line of the regulars, trying to hold in check
General Seamore's advance cavalry, who had
dismounted and were fighting on foot. The
cavalry were too strong for the lieutenant and
forced his line back on the regiment, then mounted
their horses and retreated toward Jacksonville.
As a reminder of the fight they left Lieutenant
Fort with a bullet hole through his hat. While
Lieutenant Fort was a gallant soldier, he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
gentleman in the true meaning of the word, with
his heart overflowing with kindness for his fellow-man.
One by one the regulars are crossing over
the river to join their comrades on the other shore,
who are sleeping beneath the shade of the beautiful
trees in that home where all good soldiers
who did their full and complete duty are at rest.
The last three to cross were General King, General
Lane, and Major Howard. There were about
eighty officers who served in the regulars during
the war, and I know of only eight who are still in
the land of the living&mdash;General Harrison, General
Kirklin, Colonel Twiggs, Captain Wyley, Captain
Anthony, Captain Myers, Lieutenant Palmer, and
Lieutenant Blance&mdash;and they are swiftly gliding
over the sea of time, waiting to hear the keel of
their lifeboat grate upon the other shore. Yet a
little while and the last Confederate soldier will
have crossed over the river, and their like will
never be seen again. They fought for the love of
home and country, fought without reward or the
hope of reward, fought to the last ditch, and when
all was lost except honor, furled their flags for the
last time, outnumbered five to one, but never
whipped.</p>

<p>Sweet be the sleep of Colonel John P. Fort. I
loved him while living and will cherish his memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
until I am called to answer the last roll call, and
then I hope to meet him in the home of the blest.</p>

<h2>TRIBUTE PAID BY GEORGIA
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Colonel John P. Fort</span></p>


<p>Since our last annual meeting death has removed
one of the most honored members of our
association.</p>

<p>We not only owe his memory a page in our
minutes but the younger and especially the future
members, those who shall preserve this valued
organization, would name us recalcitrant to the
true interests of our society if we failed to pay
tribute to this advanced thinker, practical scientist,
friend of humanity, evinced by his lifelong
devotion to horticulture, and advocate of all rural
betterments.</p>

<p>Thus from the mountains to the sea in our State
his name will ever be recorded in nature's annals;
sung by her fountains and embroidered by her
flowers, and men shall remember and repeat his
name with thanks when they lift the crystal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
goblet to their lips, or breathe the perfume of
earth's sweetest benefaction,&mdash;an apple orchard.</p>

<p>From hidden and unknown depths the divining
rod of his vision found and brought the sparkling
water to refresh the low lands of Georgia. In
common clay, unseen and unknown to others, he
found the lusciousness of fruit, the bloom and
fragrance of orchards to crown the peaks of Mount
Airy.</p>

<p>The mountain elevation of his north Georgia
farm, its granite foundation, its copious rainfall
he truly foresaw must become the home of the
apple industry.</p>

<p>The pioneer makes possible the success of the
economist who later benefits from the foresight
of the prophet.</p>

<p>Every member of this society appreciated the
act of the State University in conferring on him the
degree of "Doctor of Science."</p>

<p>It was a deserved tribute, fully earned.</p>

<p>His life's work is done, and this tribute can only
be an inspiration to the living.</p>

<p>May it be assigned a page to be set apart in
our records, as a memorial to his memory.</p>
